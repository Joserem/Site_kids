## Description
The page was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The landing page has a vibrant and colorful design, with a user-friendly and intuitive interface. I used HTML to structure the content of the page, CSS to style and
create a responsive layout that adapts to any screen size, and JavaScript to add interactive elements.
